			<h1>Artificial Inteligence</h1> 
      <p>While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) have surfaced over the last few decades, John McCarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (link resides outside ibm.com), " It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable."</p>

						It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR),
            computer speech recognition, or speech-to-text,
            and it is a capability which uses natural language 
            processing (NLP) to process human speech into a written 
            format. Many mobile devices incorporate speech recognition into 
            their systems to conduct voice search—e.g. Siri—or provide more 
            accessibility around texting.

							Computer vision: 
						</a> 
					</div> 
					<p class="decri"> 
						This AI technology enables computers and systems to derive 
            meaningful information from digital images, videos and other 
            visual inputs, and based on those inputs, it can take action. 
            This ability to provide recommendations distinguishes it 
            from image recognition tasks. Powered by convolutional neural 
            networks, computer vision has applications within photo tagging 
            in social media, radiology imaging in healthcare, 
            and self-driving cars within the automotive industry.

            Online virtual agents are replacing human agents along 
            the customer journey. They answer frequently asked 
            questions (FAQs) around topics, like shipping, or provide 
            personalized advice, cross-selling products or suggesting 
            sizes for users, changing the way we think about customer 
            engagement across websites and social media platforms. 
            Examples include messaging bots on e-commerce sites with 
            virtual agents, messaging apps, such as Slack and Facebook 
            Messenger, and tasks usually done by virtual assistants and 
            voice assistants.
